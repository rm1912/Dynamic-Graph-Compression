# Dynamic Graph Compression

## Introduction
- Graphs are essential data structures used to represent complex relationships between entities in various domains.
- As graphs grow in size and complexity, there is a need to efficiently compress them for storage and transmission.
- Huffman coding is a popular technique for graph compression, where frequent symbols are represented with shorter codes, reducing the overall size of the graph representation.

## Graph Compression using Huffman Coding
- Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to symbols based on their frequency of occurrence.
- In graph compression, nodes and edges are treated as symbols, and their frequencies are determined based on their occurrences in the graph.
- Nodes and edges with higher occurrences are assigned shorter codes, resulting in a more compact representation.
- The compressed graph can be efficiently reconstructed using the Huffman tree during decompression.

## Benefits of Huffman Coding for Graph Compression
- Simple and efficient algorithm for lossless compression.
- Works well for graphs with skewed node/edge frequency distributions.
- Compression ratios are higher for graphs with long-tail distribution, such as power-law graphs.

## Challenges of Huffman Coding for Graph Compression
- Building the Huffman tree introduces overhead during compression and decompression.
- Dynamic graphs with frequently changing structures pose a challenge as the Huffman tree needs to be rebuilt for each update.

## Dynamic Graph Compression Techniques
- Approaches to address dynamic graph compression:
  - Incremental Huffman Coding: Update the existing Huffman tree incrementally upon graph changes.
  - Delta Encoding: Store only the changes that occur in the graph, reducing the storage requirements.
  - Tree Rebuilding Strategies: Develop algorithms to rebuild the Huffman tree efficiently.
